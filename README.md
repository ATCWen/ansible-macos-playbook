# Ansible MacOS Playbook

This is the playbook I use after a clean install of MacOS to set everything up.

Advantages for me over using a shell script based setup

- I can run the playbook over and over again with the same results.
- Tasks are only executed when changes are needed.
- The documentation about what is done is right in the output,
  instead of only in the comments.
- When a task doesn't work anymore, for example after a new macOS release,
  I will know immediately which one and why.
- It helps me to improve my Ansible skills :)

## Installation

```bash
# Install Apple's Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew (see http://brew.sh)
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Install python
brew install python
pip3 install ansible

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/jeromegamez/ansible-macos-playbook.git
cd ansible-macos-playbook

# Run the playbooks
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

### Overriding defaults

You can override any of the defaults configured in default.config.yml by creating a config.yml file and setting the overrides in that file.

## Acknowledgements

This playbook is heavily inspired by
[Jeff Geerling's mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).

The macOS settings (a.k.a. `defaults write`s) are mostly taken from
[Mathias Bynens' defaults scripts](https://mths.be/macos) or from one of the
dotfiles repos from [http://dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io).
